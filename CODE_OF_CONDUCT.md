# Code of conduct

We endeavour to be a welcoming, kind, tolerant and fun place to learn and participate. Our intention is to set some straightforward guiding principles for our community so we are aligned on what's acceptable and what's not. Don't see this as an exhaustive list of what you can't do, but take it in the spirit of what we're trying to do - to make it easier to enrich us all as we interact with one another.

## Guiding principles

### We're welcoming

We are a welcoming space which supports all people. This includes, but is not limited to race, gender, sexuality, social class, national origin, age.

### We're kind and patient

We recognize that some of us are learning a new skill, while others have more years of experience. We are patient with each other and promote kindness and encouragement. When disagreements do occur we avoid abusive language and make efforts to be compassionate towards one another.

### We are tolerant

We recognize that a diverse group of people have different interpretations of what might cause offence. When we see this, we try to give quick, clear and constructive feedback. We offer them the opportunity to maintain their dignity in a situation and to learn and rectify from their mistake.

We do not tolerate unpleasant behavior. If someone repeatedly or deliberately acts in an offensive way, we will take decisive action to prevent any further harm.

## Examples of unacceptable behavior

- Abusive or insulting comments.
- Aggressive behavior whether in words or actions.
- Shaming others for mistakes or inexperience.
- The use of sexualised language or imagery.
- Harassing anyone - sexual or otherwise. If someone has asked you to stop, stop.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be sent to mods@quix.io. All issues are dealt with seriousness and in confidence.

If someone engages in any behavior violating this Code of Conduct, the moderators may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender in private or in public, expulsion from the community, exclusion from any interaction, and loss of all rights in this community.
