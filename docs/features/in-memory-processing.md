# In-memory processing

Traditional architectures for applications that need to process data
have always been very database-centric. This means that, when you needed
to process data and get some value out of it, everything had to pass
through a database several times. This approach worked when the amount
of data to process was relatively low, and the latency needed was on the
scale of "days". But with a world changing to more real-time use cases
where you need results on the scale of seconds or nanoseconds, and where
you can get millions of IoT devices sending data to process at the same
time, traditional database-centric architectures just explode.

The Quix SDK uses a message broker and it puts it at the very center of
the application, enabling a new approach for [processing
data](#../process.md) without the need to save and pass all the
information through a database. By using [in-memory
processing](#in-memory-processing), you can persist only the data youâ€™re
really interested in keeping.

This approach lowers the complexity and cost of real-time data
processing by several orders of magnitude and, in fact, it is the only
possible approach when you need to process a huge amount of data per
second with low latency requirements.

The SDK offers you a very simple way of processing time-series data in
real-time. Refer to the [Processing data](../../process/) section of
this documentation for further details.
