# Multiple data types

Quix Streams lets you attach any type of data, such as numbers, strings or binary data, to your timestamps.

For example, with the library you can send telemetry data from your vehicle or IoT device and attach a picture or video frame to the same timestamp.

This gives Quix Streams the ability to adapt to any streaming application, from telemetry data to video streaming, or a mix of both.
