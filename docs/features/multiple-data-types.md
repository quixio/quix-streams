# Multiple data types

Quix Streams lets you attach any type of data — Numbers, Strings or even Binary data — to your timestamps.

For example, with the library you can send telemetry data from your vehicle or IoT device and attach a picture or video frame to the same timestamp.

This gives Quix Streams the ability to adapt to any streaming application use case, from plain telemetry data to video streaming, or a mix of both.
