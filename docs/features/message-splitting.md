# Message splitting

Message Brokers always have some limitations, by design, with the maximum size of message they can handle. For example, Kafka has a 1MB limit by default, and itâ€™s not recommended to increase this number, for performance reasons. This can be a problem in some use cases where time-series data are big binary chunks, such as sound or video.

Quix Streams automatically handles large messages on the producer side, splitting them up if required and merging them back together at the consumer side, in a totally transparent way.

This feature gives you an unlimited message size, independent of the Message Broker used.
