# Horizontal scaling

The Quix SDK provides horizontal scaling out of the box via the
[streaming context](/sdk/features/streaming-context.md). This means a data
scientist or data engineer does not have to implement parallel
processing themselves.

Imagine the following example:

![Horizontal scaling initial state](../images/QuixHorizontalScaling1.png)

Each car produces one stream with its own time-series data, and each
stream is processed by each replica of the deployment, labelled
"Process". By default the message broker will assign each stream to one
replica via the [RangeAssignor
strategy](https://kafka.apache.org/23/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/RangeAssignor.html).

Now, one of the replicas crashes (the purple one), and the "stream 4" is
assigned automatically to the blue replica.

![Purple replica crashes](../images/QuixHorizontalScaling2.png)

This situation will trigger an event on the SDK in the blue replica
indicating that "stream 4" has been received:



=== "Python"
    
    ``` python
    def read_stream(new_stream: StreamReader):
        print("New stream received:" + new_stream.stream_id)
    
    input_topic.on_stream_received += read_stream
    ```

=== "C\#"
    
    ``` cs
    inputTopic.OnStreamReceived += (s, newStream) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"New stream received: {newStream.StreamId}");
    };
    ```

output on blue replica:

``` console
New stream received: stream 4
```

When the purple replica has restarted and becomes available again, it
takes back control of "stream 4".

![Purple replica has been restarted](../images/QuixHorizontalScaling3.png)

This will trigger two events, one in the blue replica indicating that
"stream 4" has been revoked, and one in the purple replica indicating
that "stream 4" has been assigned again:



=== "Python"
    
    ``` python
    def read_stream(new_stream: StreamReader):
        print("New stream received:" + new_stream.stream_id)
    
    def streams_revoked(streams_revoked: [StreamReader]):
        for stream in streams_revoked:
            print("Stream revoked:" + stream.stream_id)
    
    input_topic.on_stream_received += read_stream
    input_topic.on_streams_revoked += streams_revoked
    ```

=== "C\#"
    
    ``` cs
    inputTopic.OnStreamReceived += (s, newStream) =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"New stream received: {newStream.StreamId}");
    };
    
    inputTopic.OnStreamsRevoked += (s, streamsRevoked) =>
    {
        foreach (var stream in streamsRevoked)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Stream revoked: {stream.StreamId}");
        }
    };
    ```

Output on the blue replica:

``` console
Stream revoked: stream 4
```

Output on the purple replica:

``` console
New stream received: stream 4
```

The same behaviour will happen if we scale the "Process" deployment up
or down, increasing or decreasing the number of replicas. Kafka will
trigger the rebalacing mechanism internally and this will trigger the
same events on the Quix SDK.

## Rebalancing mechanism and Partitions

Kafka uses partitions and the [RangeAssignor
strategy](https://kafka.apache.org/23/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/RangeAssignor.html)
to decide which consumers receive which messages. Partitions and the
Kafka rebalancing protocol are internal details of the Kafka
implementation behind the Quix SDK. You donâ€™t need to worry about them
because everything is abstracted within the [Streaming
Context](/sdk/features/streaming-context.md) feature of the SDK. The
events described above will remain the same, even if the SDK uses
another Message Broker technology or another rebalancing mechanism in
the future.

!!! warning

	Because of how the Kafka rebalancing mechanism works, you should follow one golden rule: you cannot have more replicas than the number of partitions the input Topic has.
