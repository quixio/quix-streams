# Portability

The Quix SDK works as an abstraction layer on top of a concrete broker technology like Kafka.

The SDK sits on top of a Kafka layer and solves all the common problems you might face when processing time-series data using the Kafka technology. However, in future, we can use different message broker technologies without changing the common SDK interface.

Using the Quix SDK, youâ€™re not locked into a specific broker technology. You can innovate over time and change the underlying technologies without changing a single line of code of your solution.
