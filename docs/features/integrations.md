# Integrations

The Quix SDK offers very useful integrations with the Quix SaaS platform
out of the box, some of them to persist and query historical data, and
some of them to produce and consume data for uses cases where you cannot
use the Quix SDK directly, like Web applications:

  - Data persistence: Make any Topic persist all the streaming data it
    receives, with the click of a button on Quix Portal.

  - [Query API](#apis::data-catalogue-api/intro.md): Query historical
    data with powerful filters and aggregation capabilities.

  - [Streaming Reader API](#apis::streaming-reader-api/intro.md):
    Consume stream data in real time with a Websockets interface. Used
    for Web applications use cases.

  - [Streaming Writer API](#apis::streaming-writer-api/intro.md): Push
    streaming data into a Topic using REST via HTTP endpoints. Used for
    Web applications use cases.
