# Tutorial: Word Counts

We will build a simple word counter, which is a great introduction to Quix Streams and Kafka!

You'll learn how to:

- Create a topic
- Do simple event alterations
- Generate multiple events from a single event
- Filter any undesired events
- Produce events, with new Kafka keys, to a topic



## Outline of the Problem

Imagine we are a company with various products. 

We want to process text reviews for our various products in real time 
and see what words are the most popular across all of them.

We need an application that will split reviews into individual words, and then send
the counts of each individually downstream for further processing.



## Our Example

We will use a simple producer to generate text to be processed by our 
new Word Counter application.

NOTE: our example uses JSON formatting for Kafka message values.



## Event Expansion
 
The most important concept we want to explore here is how you can "expand" a single
event into multiple new ones.

More than that: each new event generated via expansion is processed individually
through the remainder of your pipeline, allowing you to write ALL your operations 
like they are handling a single event...because they are!

NOTE: Expanding often includes adjusting outgoing Kafka keys as well, so we additionally
showcase that.

## Generating Text Data

We have a [**>>> Review Producer <<<**](producer.py) that generates a static set of "reviews", 
which are simply strings, where the key is the product name.

The Kafka message looks like:

```python
# ...
{kafka_key: 'product_one', kafka_value: "WOW I love product_one. It is the best."}
{kafka_key: 'product_two', kafka_value: "Fire the creator of product_two please."}
# etc...
```


## Word Counter Application

Now let's go over our [**>>> Word Counter Application <<<**](application.py) line-by-line!

### Create Application

```python
import os
from quixstreams import Application

app = Application(
    broker_address=os.environ.get("BROKER_ADDRESS", "localhost:9092"),
    consumer_group="product_review_word_counter",
    auto_offset_reset="earliest"
)
```

First, create the [Quix Streams Application](../../configuration.md), which is our constructor for everything! We provide it our connection settings, consumer group (ideally unique per Application), and where the consumer group should start from on our topic. 

NOTE: Once you are more familiar with Kafka, we recommend [learning more about auto_offset_reset](https://www.quix.io/blog/kafka-auto-offset-reset-use-cases-and-pitfalls).

### Define Topics

```python
product_reviews_topic = app.topic(name="product_reviews")
word_counts_topic = app.topic(name="product_review_word_counts")
```

Next we define our input/output topics, named `product_reviews` and `product_review_word_counts`, respectively. 

They each return [`Topic`](../../api-reference/topics.md) objects, used later on.

NOTE: the topics will automatically be created for you in Kafka when you run the application should they not exist.


### The StreamingDataFrame (SDF)

```python
sdf = app.dataframe(topic=product_reviews_topic)
```

Now for the fun part: building our [StreamingDataFrame](../../processing.md#introduction-to-streamingdataframe), often shorthanded to "SDF".  

SDF allows manipulating the message value in a dataframe-like fashion using various operations.

After initializing, we continue re-assigning to the same `sdf` variable as we add operations.

(Also: notice that we pass our input `Topic` from the previous step to it.)

### Tokenizing Text

```python
from collections import Counter

def tokenize_and_count(text):
    words = Counter(text.lower().replace(".", " ").split()).items()
    return words

sdf = sdf.apply(tokenize_and_count, expand=True)
```

This is where most of the magic happens! 

We alter our text data with [`SDF.apply(F)`](../../processing.md#streamingdataframeapply) (`F` should take your current 
message value as an argument, and return your new message value):
our `F` here is `tokenize_and_count`.

Basically we do some fairly typical string normalization and count the words, resulting in (word, count) pairs.


This effectively turns this:

`>>> "Bob likes bananas and Frank likes apples."`

to this:

`>>> [('bob', 1), ('likes', 2), ('bananas', 1), ('and', 1), ('frank', 1), ('apples', 1)]`


NOTE: two VERY important and related points around the `expand=True` argument:

1. it tells SDF "hey, this .apply() returns _**multiple independent**_ events!"

2. Our `F` returns a `list` (or a non-dict iterable of some kind), hence the "expand"!


### Filtering Expanded Results

```python
def should_skip(word_count_pair):
    word, count = word_count_pair
    return word not in ['i', 'a', 'we', 'it', 'is', 'and', 'or', 'the']

sdf = sdf.filter(should_skip)
```

Now we filter out some "filler" words using [`SDF.filter(F)`](../../processing.md#streamingdataframefilter), where `F` is our `should_skip` function. 

For `SDF.filter(F)`, if the (_**boolean**_-ed) return value of `F` is: 

- `True` -> continue processing this event

- `False` -> stop ALL further processing of this event (including produces!)

Remember that each word is now an independent event now due to our previous expand, so our
`F` expects only a single word count pair.

With this filter applied, our "and" event is removed:

`>>> [('bob', 1), ('likes', 2), ('bananas', 1), ('frank', 1), ('apples', 1)]`


### Producing Events With New Keys

```python
sdf = sdf.to_topic(word_counts_topic, key=lambda word_count_pair: word_count_pair[0])
```

Finally, we produce each event downstream (they will be independent messages) 
via [`SDF.to_topic(T)`](../../processing.md#writing-data-to-kafka-topics), where `T` is our previously defined `Topic` (not the topic name!).

Notice here the optional `key` argument, which allows you to provide a [custom key generator](../../processing.md#changing-message-key-before-producing).

While it's fairly common to maintain the input event's key (SDF's default behavior), 
there are many reasons why you might adjust it...like here (NOTE: advanced concept below)!

We are changing the message key to the word; this data structure enables 
calculating _total word counts over time_ from this topic (with a new application, of course!).

In the end we would produce 5 messages in total, like so:

```python
# two shown here...
{kafka_key: "bob", kafka_value: ["bob", 1]}
{kafka_key: "likes", kafka_value: ["likes", 2]}
# etc...
```

## Try it yourself!

### 1. Run Kafka
First, have a running Kafka cluster. 

To conveniently follow along with this tutorial, just [run this simple one-liner](../tutorials-overview.md#running-kafka-locally).

### 2. Install Quix Streams
In your python environment, run `pip install quixstreams`

### 3. Run the Producer and Application
Just call `python producer.py` and `python application.py` in separate windows.

### 4. Check out the results!

Look at all those counted works, beautiful!
