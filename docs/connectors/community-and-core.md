# Community and Core Connectors

Quix Streams provides two kinds of Sinks and Sources with different levels of support:

- **Core connectors**: these connectors are developed or maintained by the Quix Streams team.
They live in [quixstreams/sources/core](https://github.com/quixio/quix-streams/tree/main/quixstreams/sources/core) and [quixstreams/sinks/core](https://github.com/quixio/quix-streams/tree/main/quixstreams/sinks/core) folders.  
They are production-ready, thoroughly tested, documented, and updated regularly.

- **Community connectors**: these connectors are developed by the community members.
They live in [quixstreams/sources/community](https://github.com/quixio/quix-streams/tree/main/quixstreams/sources/community) and [quixstreams/sinks/community](https://github.com/quixio/quix-streams/tree/main/quixstreams/sinks/community) folders.
Quix Streams' maintainers review them before merging, but they don't add or maintain new features directly.    
Community connectors are not guaranteed to be fully tested and stable.  
Community connectors can become core if they are widely used.

To contribute a new community connector, check out the [Connectors Contribution Guide](contribution-guide.md).
