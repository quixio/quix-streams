# Kafka Replicator Source

A source that reads data from a Kafka topic and produce it to another Kafka topic. The two topics can be located on different Kafka clusters.

This source supports exactly-once guarantees.

## How to use the Kafka Replicator Source

To use a Kafka Replicator source, you need to create an instance of `KafkaReplicatorSource` and pass it to the `app.dataframe()` method.

```python
from quixstreams import Application
from quixstreams.sources import KafkaReplicatorSource

def main():
  app = Application()
  source = KafkaReplicatorSource(
    name="my-source",
    app_config=app.config,
    topic="source-topic",
    broker_address="source-broker-address"
  )

  sdf = app.dataframe(source=source)
  sdf.print(metadata=True)

  app.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

## Topic

The Kafka Replicator source only deals with bytes. It reads the remote keys and values as bytes and produces them directly as bytes.
You can configure the key and value deserializer used by the Streaming Dataframe with the `key_deserializer` and `value_deserializer` paramaters.

## Consumer group

The Kafka Replicator consumer group is the source name prefixed by `source-`. Changing the name will reset the source state and it will re-replicate the data based on the configured `auto_offset_reset`. It is not based on the application consumer group, changing the application consumer group will not reset the source.

For more information about consumer group [see the glosary](https://quix.io/docs/kb/glossary.html?h=consumer+group#consumer-group)
