# State management

A Quix deployment and its underlying code can be restarted multiple times. This can happen because of either user intervention (manually stopping and starting the deployment) or because of a runtime error in the code. In the second case, where a runtime error is detected, the Quix Serverless Environment automatically detects the problem and restarts the underlying service in an attempt to recover from the fault.

Due to the code being run in memory, each time a deployment restarts, internal variables will be reset. For example, if you were to calculate the count of the elements in the stream, this counter would get reset on each restart. The counter would then starts at the default variable not knowing what was the last known value in the state of previous run before program stopped working.

The Quix SDK has state management built in to allow values to be used and persisted across restarts of a given deployment. We persist the state to dedicated and private key-value pair storage in your workspace.

## Usage

To use the SDKâ€™s state management feature create an instance of *LocalFileStorage*. This is in *quixstreaming.state.localfilestorage*. Then use the set, get, containsKey and clear methods to manipulate the state as needed.

=== "Python"
    
    ``` python
    from quixstreaming.state.localfilestorage import LocalFileStorage
    
    storage = LocalFileStorage()
    
    #clear storage ( remove all keys )
    storage.clear()
    
    #storage class supports handling of
    #   `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `bytes`, `bytearray` types.
    
    #set value
    storage.set("KEY1", 12.51)
    storage.set("KEY2", "str")
    storage.set("KEY3", True)
    storage.set("KEY4", False)
    
    #check if the storage contains key
    storage.containsKey("KEY1")
    
    #get value
    value = storage.get("KEY1")
    ```

=== "C\#"
    C\# supports two ways to call the Storage API.
    
      - Synchronous
    
      - Asynchronous ( methods are with Async suffix )
    
    The Synchronous API. During a call to these synchronous methods, the
    program thread execution is blocked.
    
    ``` cs
    var storage = new LocalFileStorage();
    
    //clear storage ( remove all keys )
    await storage.Clear();
    
    //set value to specific key
    await storage.Set("KEY1", 123);  //long
    await storage.Set("KEY2", 1.23); //double
    await storage.Set("KEY3", "1.23"); //string
    await storage.Set("KEY4", new byte[]{12,53,23}); //binary
    await storage.Set("KEY5", false); //boolean
    
    //check if the key exists
    await storage.ContainsKey("KEY1");
    
    //retrieve value from key
    await storage.GetLong("KEY1");
    await storage.GetDouble("KEY2");
    await storage.GetString("KEY3");
    await storage.GetBinary("KEY4");
    await storage.GetBinary("KEY5");
    
    //list all keys in the storage
    await storage.GetAllKeys();
    ```
    
    The asynchronous API in which methods do contain Async suffix. These
    methods use the Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) and return
    Tasks. TAP allows us to use async / await and avoid blocking the
    main thread on longer-running operations. In this case internal I/O.
    
    ``` cs
    var storage = new LocalFileStorage();
    
    //clear storage ( remove all keys )
    await storage.ClearAsync();
    
    //set value to specific key
    await storage.SetAsync("KEY1", 123);  //long
    await storage.SetAsync("KEY2", 1.23); //double
    await storage.SetAsync("KEY3", "1.23"); //string
    await storage.SetAsync("KEY4", new byte[]{12,53,23}); //binary
    await storage.SetAsync("KEY5", false); //boolean
    
    //check if the key exists
    await storage.ContainsKeyAsync("KEY1");
    
    //retrieve value from key
    await storage.GetLongAsync("KEY1");
    await storage.GetDoubleAsync("KEY2");
    await storage.GetStringAsync("KEY3");
    await storage.GetBinaryAsync("KEY4");
    await storage.GetBinaryAsync("KEY5");
    
    //list all keys in the storage
    await storage.GetAllKeysAsync();
    ```
