        A base class for all streaming operations.

        `Stream` is an abstraction of a function pipeline.
        Each Stream has a function and a parent (None by default).
        When adding new function to the stream, it creates a new `Stream` object and
        sets "parent" to the previous `Stream` to maintain an order of execution.

        Streams supports four types of functions:

        - "Apply" - generate new values based on a previous one.
            The result of an Apply function is passed downstream to the next functions.
            If "expand=True" is passed and the function returns an `Iterable`,
            each item of it will be treated as a separate value downstream.
        - "Update" - update values in-place.
            The result of an Update function is always ignored, and its input is passed
            downstream.
        - "Filter" - to filter values from the Stream.
            The result of a Filter function is interpreted as boolean.
            If it's `True`, the input will be passed downstream.
            If it's `False`, the record will be filtered from the stream.
        - "Transform" - to transform keys and timestamps along with the values.
            "Transform" functions may change the keys and should be used with caution.
            The result of the Transform function is passed downstream to the next
            functions.
            If "expand=True" is passed and the function returns an `Iterable`,
            each item of it will be treated as a separate value downstream.

        To execute the functions on the `Stream`, call `.compose()` method, and
        it will return a closure to execute all the functions accumulated in the Stream
        and its parents.
