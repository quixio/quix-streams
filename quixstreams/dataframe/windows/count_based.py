        Count based windows are different from time based windows as we don't
        have a clear indicator on when a window starts, it depends on the
        previous window. On the other hand there is a clear marker on when it
        must end, we can close the window as soon as the window is full.

        As count windows can't rely on ordered timestamps, collection need
        another way to generate ordered ids. We can use a per-key counter for
        that, each incoming message will increment the key counter. Collection
        window then only need to know at what id they start, how many messages
        to get on completion and how many messages can be safely deleted.

        We can further optimise this by removing the global counter and relying
        on the previous window state to compute a message id. For example, if
        an active window starts at msg id 32 and has a count of 3 it means the
        next free msg id is 35 (32 + 3).

        For tumbling windows there is no window overlap so we can't rely on that
        optimisation. Instead the msg id reset to 0 on every new window.
